Opening
///////Taniya Talukdar
.Open with some anecdotes about people who would gain access to metroparks via our app. 
Examples: A coworker's (Carole's) husband has bad knees and can no longer go on the hikes he used to love.
 A teacher who doesn't have the luxury of busing their urban students out to the Metroparks. 
 Someone has agoraphobia and doesn't feel comfortable going out in public but needs an immersive nature experience.
 An experienced hiker looking to explore a new trail gets help choosing where to go next
.Have you ever been in a position where you see problems arising but don't have the resources to solve them?
.[Show the screenshot of the list of problems Metroparks already identified with the problems we solve highlighted.]
.~Something about our app addressing the problems: attracts new users, allows access to those currently without,
    better informs the public and gives naturalists a chance to shine
.Go to maps.clevelandmetroparks.com and click through to where a button would be to where our app would be utilized
    and walk them through it 
.Switch tabs and go into our app already open in appharbor.

.(Anonymous user:) can see different seasons within the panoramics, different times of day, hear different 
    sounds based on these different temporal environments. Frogs at night, birdsong in spring and mornings, the 
    crunch of snow in winter.
.User: can add pictures, videos, and sounds within their own account, can upvote existing points of interest and 
    hotspots, can create new possible points of interest, and can have a settings option for the speed on the autoplay
    of the trail so they don't have to reset it on every page.
.Admins: can edit and remove hotspots, approve or disapprove of user content before it becomes public, and can
    add new panoramics and sounds.
.Admins and users: will have a dashboard that allows them to view their favorite trails, their account settings,
    the content they've specifically added.
.Feasibility and scalability: Pull up an existing panoramic, ask them if it looks good. Show a slide of a 3D
    expensive-looking hard-to-use camera mounted, then a slide of the same image with the circle and slash through
    it. ~"Fortunately, you don't need this time-consuming equipment to make more trails accessible through our
    app." Explain that it can (and has) been done using a three year old cell phone and a free built-in app (we
    used Craig's Android, which just needed to download a feature for the existing built-in photo app). Each picture
    is less than 4MB, affordable to store and quick to create.
.Final statements, undiscussed
