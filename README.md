## Summary

To begin your journey, please visit [our AppHarbor site](http://virtualmetroparks.apphb.com).

From the start screen, the user has the opportunity to select a park from the Cleveland Metroparks system from a set of marked options, then select a trail from within that park. From there, the user in ready to explore the trail.
